The labs, which served as prerequisites for this homework, have been successfully completed.
After finishing part 1 for both labs, our focus shifted to completing the "ExecuteW" function in order to create the required DLL for the homework.

Once the initial draft of the DLL was ready, we tested its functionality using the provided loader in hw8.
The first draft did not fulfill the requirement of accepting arguments for hw10.
Modifications were made to the DLL to address the issues, and it was made to work correctly.
Subsequently, we made necessary adjustments to the CLI and server code to ensure they performed the required tasks.

With the DLL, CLI, and server code ready, we shifted our attention to getting the client side to function correctly.
We realized that in hw8, there was a mistake of writing the DLL to the disk, which we corrected to avoid repeating the same error in this assignment.
After rectifying all our mistakes, the client for hw10 was successfully implemented, and it performed all the required tasks.
We are now proceeding to complete the test cases.
Here is the time breakdown for the completion of the homework:
5.1 Actual Time: 6 hours
5.2 Expected Time: 10 hours
