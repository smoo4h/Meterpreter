We have initiated our efforts to comprehend the assignment specifications.
We have realized that it will be necessary to work on the "config.h" file in order to define all the constants.
July 6th:

Upon grasping the requirements for type 8, we commenced working on our code.
We also established the requirements within our config.h file.
July 9th:

While attempting to send the JSON request, we encountered an error.
July 10th:

We successfully resolved the error, and our code now operates correctly according to all the requirements.
Ultimately, this assignment was completed earlier than expected, as we had already implemented a significant portion of the code in previous homework and labs, thus reducing the actual time. The following statistics outline the estimated and actual time:
2.1. Estimated time: 12 hours
2.2. Actual time: Approximately 11.5 hours
