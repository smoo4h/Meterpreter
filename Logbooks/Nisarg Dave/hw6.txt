	1. We worked on task 2.
	2. We referred to the Download code we had used previously on labs and hw and finished our code for task 2.

	1. We worked on test cases to test our hw. All of our defined test cases were working as expected.
	2. Completed all the required .md files.
	3. Finally, this assignment was completed before our estimated time as the major part of the code was implemented by us beforehand in previous hw and labs, thus reducing the actual time. The following is the stats listing estimated and actual time:
		3.1. Estimated time: 10 hours
		3.2. Actual time: 8 hours approximately
