    1. Today we are stuck with a code which only downloads 1366kb of the entire file. 
    2. We have tried debugging it and implementing it in a different way but we cant seem to come up with plausible explaination.
    3. Due to this we decided to explore a bit and meet tomorrow.

    1. These two days pretty much went in solving the issue that we were facing reagarding the accepting chunk of data from the server.
    2. All three of us tried different approach, a different outlook so that we can reach to a solution.
    3. By the end of the day we were able to solve the solution and our code was working as expected.
    4. Now the only thing that was left was to make a readme.md file and complete different bat files to try out the test cases.

    1. After making some minor changes in the code, we updated our ReadMe.md file.
    2. We also make some changes in the server code and the details about is mentioned in the changes.md file.
    3. All the test cases are working properly and the final code also works perfectly.
    4. Finally, here is our statistics on estimated time of project completion versus the actual time taken for completion
  4.1. Estimated time: 10 hours
  4.2. Actual time: 13 hours
